EPIDEMICA

Select one of 4 diseases-> each is strong in certain regions
Choose a region; base colonization rate= 5 units (+- 1 based on choice vis a vis susceptibility)
Base Eradication Rate: 50 turns

Every [3,8] turns, you are given a random mutation (from choices 1 to 9)
Favoured Spread: Base Colonization Rate=4
Impeded Spread: Base Colonization Rate=6
Strain Evolution: Eradication rate increases by [5,15]
Strain Extinction: Eradication rate decreases by [1,5]
Severe Symptoms: Mutation rate becomes [2,7]
Weak Symptoms: Mutation rate becomes [4, 9]
Antibiotic Resistance: Every time a mutation is given, the eradication rate increases by 10% BUT Strain Evolution Mutation makes eradication rate by only [2, 12]
Medical R&D: Every time a mutation is given, the eradication rate decreases by 10% BUT Strain Evolution Mutation makes eradication rate to [7, 17]
Colonization: Spread to a new region of 30 countries apart from the ones you are already in

If you cover all regions you win; Else if you get eradicated you are dead.

Finally, output the number of countries conquered and display pre-coded compliments based on how many that is. (Good job, you read this whole thing!)
